Here's how you can set up Git from scratch while starting a new project:

Steps:

Check if Git is already installed on your system using the command: git -v.

If it is not installed, download and install it for your operating system from below url.
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder using the command: git init.

Use the command git status to check the status of your local Git repository.

Create a sample file: echo "A sample file is created" >> Sample.txt.

Add the sample file from untracked to the staged area using: git add Sample.txt.

Commit the file to the local Git repository with: git commit -m "Added Readme file".

Register your global user details for authentication:

git config --global user.email "rajat121237@gmail.com"

git config --global user.name "Rajat Kumar Pandey"

Add the remote repository URL: git remote add origin https://github.com/Rajat121237/DSA.git.

Push your commits to the master branch of the remote repository: git push -u origin master.

All set to go! ðŸš€
